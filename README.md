# jlk-loc8r
Mean loc8r program by Â© Getting Mean - Simon Holmes/Clive Harber 2018

I created this project optionally in tandem with my Full-stack I course project. It was not part of the course, essentially. I was simply following the book which used different frameworks and tools- to get to see how we do it the book's way. About midway through or toward the end of the course, my other project demanded too much attention. Therefore I stopped creating this optional project in order to reinforce my efforts for the one required to pass the course.

I decided to allow viewing of this project, simply so that others can see some of the additional tools and the framework i used (this project uses Pug, while my other project uses bootstrap.
